# PrefIntNN
A neural network for integrating data via pairwise loss function. The PrefIntNN package provides a neural network-based way of integrating data via learning pairwise relations. Please check our paper at:https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsmedchemlett.1c00439.    
This is an extension of our previous Gaussian process-based package [PrefInt](https://github.com/tsudalab/PrefInt).
# Tutorial
The model requires specific form of data input. For data preparation, please check: [tutorial](https://github.com/tsudalab/PrefIntNN/blob/master/Data_Preparation_Tutorial.ipynb)    
The model is implemented via Pytorch. For training model, please refer: [Tutorial](https://github.com/tsudalab/PrefIntNN/blob/master/Model_Training_and_Prediction.ipynb)
